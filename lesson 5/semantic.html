                <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>

                <p>
                    Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, 
                    dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, 
                    and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 
                    15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you feel like you have to do it 
                    anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate 
                    future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

                    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived 
                    from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
                    Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago 
                    before the development of agriculture.
